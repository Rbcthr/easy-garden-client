# Easy Garden Client ‚Äî Plant Care Community App in React üåø

A client-side React app for a community site about gardening. Users create accounts, log in, post tips, and discuss plant care. The UI uses Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. Auth and data use Firebase. Swiper handles galleries. Small, focused components make the app easy to read and extend.

## Key components
- AuthForm ‚Äî sign-up and sign-in UI with validation.
- TipEditor ‚Äî create/edit post UI with image upload to Firebase Storage.
- TipCard ‚Äî compact post view with like/comment actions.
- TipList ‚Äî paginated feed using Firestore queries.
- Carousel ‚Äî Swiper wrapper for image galleries.
- ThemeToggle ‚Äî dark/light toggle using react-toggle-dark-mode.
- ToastWrapper ‚Äî central toast container using react-toa.

---

## Routing and pages
Routes follow this pattern:
- / ‚Äî home feed
- /post/:id ‚Äî single post view with comments
- /create ‚Äî create new tip (auth required)
- /edit/:id ‚Äî edit tip (author only)
- /profile/:uid ‚Äî user profile and user tips
- /login ‚Äî sign-in / sign-up
- /about ‚Äî project info and contributors

All route guards use a simple auth context and redirect to /login if not authenticated.

---

## Data flow and Firebase
- Auth: Firebase Auth with JWTs handled by the SDK.
- Data: Firestore collections:
  - posts ‚Äî main tip documents { title, body, authorId, images[], createdAt, likes }
  - comments ‚Äî subcollection under posts
  - users ‚Äî basic profile data and bio
- Storage: Images upload to Firebase Storage and save the public URL in the post document.
- Security: Firestore rules should restrict writes to authenticated users and allow only owners to edit/delete their posts.

Example Firestore write (pseudo)
```js
const ref = firestore.collection('posts').doc();
await ref.set({
  title,
  body,
  authorId: user.uid,
  images,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
});
```

---

## Styling and assets
The app uses Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for components. DaisyUI adds ready-made components; the project keeps styles in utility classes and small component-level CSS.

Image gallery uses Swiper.js. Animations use react-awesome-reveal for subtle motion. Typewriter headings use react-simple-typewriter.

Icons come from react-icons (Feather, Heroicons, FontAwesome). Toasts come from react-toa.

---

## Testing and linting
Basic scripts are in package.json:
```bash
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run format     # prettier
npm run test       # runs tests if present
npm run build      # production build
npm run preview    # preview production build
```
Add unit tests for critical hooks and services. Mock Firebase with a local emulator for stable CI runs.
